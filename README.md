Personality Detection using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
Title: MBTI Personality Detection using TF-IDF and ML

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project includes an end-to-end solution for personality detection based on textual data.

Features:
1. Data Collection: Includes scripts and resources for collecting a diverse dataset of written text samples along with corresponding MBTI types.

2. Preprocessing: Contains code for text preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization/stemming to prepare the textual data for analysis.

3. Feature Extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique for feature extraction, converting textual data into numerical feature vectors.

4. Model Selection and Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms for multi-class classification tasks, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest,  and Naive Bayes. Includes code for model training and evaluation.

5. Deployment: Offers a deployable solution for personality detection, allowing users to input written text and receive predictions of MBTI types with corresponding confidence scores.
